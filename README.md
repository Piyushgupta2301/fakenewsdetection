a datscience project on fake news detection

#The problem
The problem is not only hackers, going into accounts, and sending false information. The bigger problem here is what we call "Fake News". A fake are those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources, or quotes.
When someone (or something like a bot) impersonates someone or a reliable source to false spread information, that can also be considered as fake news. In most cases, the people creating this false information have an agenda, that can be political, economical or to change the behavior or thought about a topic.
